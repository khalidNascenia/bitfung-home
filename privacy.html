                    collects, uses, maintains and discloses user information obtained through
                    the Bitfung website (the “Site”). The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to
                    Bitfung. By using the Site, you (“User”) consent to the data practices prescribed
                    in this Privacy Policy. On occasion, Bitfung may revise this Privacy Policy to
                    reflect changes in law, our personal data collection and use practices, the
                    features on the Site, or advances in technology. If material changes are made to this Privacy Policy, the changes
                    will be prominently posted on the Site. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings
                    ascribed to them in the Terms of Use. </p>
                <p>Please note: This Privacy Policy does not cover any information that we may receive about you through channels

                <h4>What information does Bitfung collect?</h4>
                <p>We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>
                <p><b>“Personal Data”</b> means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name,
                    address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated
                    with or linked to any of the foregoing data. <b>“Anonymous Data”</b> means data that is not associated with or linked to your
                    Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.</p>
                <div class="kyc-list">
                    <ul class="exchange-content--list">
                        <li>We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses,
                            date of birth, government issued identification, photographs, biometric information (including but not

                        <li>We may also collect other Personal Data provided by third party identity verification services
                            or via social networking websites.</li>
                        <li>If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device or computer to send us your location),
                            we may store that information.</li>
                        <li>Certain services, such as two-factor authentication, may require our collection of your phone number.
                            We may associate that phone number to your mobile device identification information.</li>
                        <li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as
                            any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</li>
                        <li>We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily when seeking support services,
                            such as email, information submitted via online form, video conferencing service information, other contact information,
                            or other information provided to support services staff.</li>
                        <li>We may collect other data, including but not limited to, referral URLs, your location, blockchain analytics information related

                        <li>Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a
