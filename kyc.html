                        <p>Money laundering is any transaction or series of transactions

                            that have been obtained from illegal activity. The main objective
                            of the money launderer is to transform illegally obtained money
                            into seemingly legal money or other assets in the way so
                            transformation does not leave any or little trace. Examples of illegal
                            activities that often involve money laundering
                            are: drug trafficking; terrorism; smuggling; fraud; bribery; robbery;
                            embezzlement; and illegal gambling. More details you can find in the

                            <li>What is money laundering?</li>
                            <p>Money laundering represents various types of manipulation with cash
                                funds aimed at concealing the illegal origin of illicitly acquired
                                funds.  Illicit funds, according to the Singapore law are defined as
                                those acquired directly or indirectly, through a criminal activity or
                                in other cases specified in the Criminal Procedure Law. </p>
                            <li>Know your client principle or why are financial institutions asking
                                questions?</li>
                            <p>Similar to worldwide practices, the financial institutions in Hong Kong
                                apply ‘know your client’ (KYC) principle. KYC principle is aimed at
                                reduction of risk of undermining the financial institution’s reputation
                                due to the clients’ involvement in the transactions of money laundering
                                or terrorism financing.</p>
                            <p>The goal of this principle is to obtain the necessary information about
                                clients and the origination of their funds, and to ensure, that such
                                funds do not have criminal origination and are not used for illicit
                                purposes. In order to assess and control such risks, the financial
                                institutions have to inquire into the profiles of their clients,
                                transactions and the origins of their funds to meet the provisions
                                of the following laws and regulations: </p>
