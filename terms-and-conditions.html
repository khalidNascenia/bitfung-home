                          <p>Bitfung acts as a facilitator to help customers accept payments and
                              to help customers make payments. Bitfung has independent
                              relationships with the sender and the receiver of payments.
                              We act based upon your direction and your requests to use our
                              Services that require us to perform tasks on your behalf. Bitfung
                              will at all times hold your funds separate from its corporate funds,
                              will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other
                              corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make funds available
                              to its creditors. You acknowledge that (a) Bitfung is not a bank
                              and the Service is a payment processing service rather than a
                              banking service, and (b) Bitfung is not acting as a trustee,
                              fiduciary or escrow with respect to your funds, but is acting
                              only as an agent and custodian. </p>
                          <p>By using Bitfung Services you further agree to the following
                                statements:</p>

                                in order to use the Service, except in certain circumstances where
                                Bitfung reasonably determines your account poses a risk. Bitfung
                                will pool your funds together with funds from other Users, and will
                                place those funds in accounts at one or more financial
                                institutions ("Pooled Accounts"). </p>
                            <p>You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the
                                funds you may keep in your Bitfung.</p>
                            <p>By initiating and making payments through the Service or, where available,
                                adding funds to your balance, you authorize Bitfung to accept funds on
                                your behalf, and to send the funds to the recipient that you designate or
                                into Bitfung Exchange Account, subject to the terms and restrictions of
                                this Agreement. </p>
                            <p>When you initiate a payment, Bitfung will offset funds from the
                                Exchange Account for your benefit to the recipient. When you
                                make a payment, until that payment clears our risk checks and
                                is accepted by the recipient (which may occur instantly or take
                                a few days), you remain the owner of those funds and Bitfung holds
                                those funds for your benefit and on your behalf, but you will not be
                                able to withdraw those funds or send the funds to any other recipient
                                unless you cancel the initial transaction.</p>
                            <p>By receiving payments through the Service, you appoint Bitfung as your
                                agent to cause the funds to be deposited on your behalf in the
                                Exchange Accounts until you further instruct Bitfung with respect
                                to the transmission of your funds. Through the Bitfung Website,
                                you may provide instructions to withdraw the funds or send the funds
                                to a third party, in each case subject to the terms and restrictions
                                of this Agreement. </p>
                          </ol>
                          <p>1.2 Bitfung is only a Payment Service Provider</p>
                          <p>Bitfung acts as a payment service provider by creating, hosting,
                              maintaining and providing our Service to you via the Internet.
                              We do not have any control over, and are not responsible or
                              liable for, the products or services that are paid for with
                              our Service. We cannot ensure that a buyer or a seller you are
                              dealing with will actually complete the transaction. </p>
                          <p>1.3 Identity Authentication</p>
                          <p>We use many techniques to identify our users when they register
                              on our site. Verification of Users is only an indication of
                              increased likelihood that a User's identity is correct.
                              You authorize Bitfung, directly or through third parties,
                              to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your
                              identity and registration. This may include requiring you to
                              provide Bitfung with fax or scanned documentation such as a
                              government issued identification card, address verification
                              documentation, ordering a credit report and performing other
                              credit checks or verifying the information you provide against
                              third party databases. However, because user verification on the

                          <p>1.9 Indemnification</p>
                          <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Bitfung, its parent, subsidiaries,
                              affiliates, officers, directors and employees harmless from any
                              claim or demand (including lawyers’ fees) made or incurred by
                              any third party due to or arising out of your breach of
                              this Agreement or the documents it incorporates by reference, or
                              your violation of any law or the rights of a third party relating
                              to your use of the Service.</p>
                          <p>1.10 Liability for Violations of the Acceptable Use Policy</p>
                          <p>If you engage in the following behavior, Bitfung may suspend or
                              restrict your access to the Services, hold your funds up to 180 days
                              and fine you, as explained below. Using the Service to receive
                              payments for any sexually oriented or obscene materials or services
                              in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy;</p>
                          <p>Using the Bitfung service to receive payments for any narcotics,
                              other controlled substances, steroids or prescription drugs in

                          <p>You and Bitfung agree that the damages that Bitfung will sustain
                              as a result of the behavior outlined above will be substantial,
                              including (without limitation) fines and other related expenses
                              from its payment processors and service providers, but may be
                              extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. In the event
                              that you engage in such activities, then Bitfung may fine you up
                              to USD 3,500.00 for each such violation and/or Bitfung may take
                              legal action against you to recover losses that are in excess
                              of the amount fined. You acknowledge and agree that a fine up to
                              USD 3,500.00 is presently a reasonable and genuine minimum estimate
                              of Bitfung damages, considering all currently existing circumstances. </p>
                          <p>If you use the Service in a manner that violates this Agreement,
                              the documents incorporated by reference into this Agreement or
                              the Bitfung Acceptable Use Policy, including but not limited to
                              the two categories described above, your account will be subject
                              to limitation or immediate termination.</p>
                          <p>You agree that, if either you or Bitfung commence litigation or
                              arbitration in connection with this paragraph, the prevailing
                              party is entitled to recover reasonable lawyers’ fees and any
                              other costs incurred in such proceeding in addition to any other
                              relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled. </p>
                          <p>1.11 Liability for reversals</p>
                          <p>Payments received in your Bitfung Account may be reversed
                              at a later time. This means that a payment may be reversed
                              from your Bitfung Account after you have provided the sender
                              the goods or services that were purchased. </p>

                          <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of payments
                              you can send through the Service. Once you reach your sending limit,
                              you will be required to verify your Bitfung Account before using
                              Bitfung to send any more payments.</p>
                          <p>"Verified Account" means an Account status that reflects that Bitfung
                              has verified that an Account holder has legal control of one or
                              more of his or her payment methods. A Verified Account status does
                              not constitute an endorsement of a User or a guarantee of a User's

                          <p>When you send a payment, the recipient is not required to accept it.

                          <p>2.1.3 Multiple Currencies</p>
                          <p>Bitfung Multiple Currencies feature allows users to send payments
                              in various currencies. Restrictions may apply regarding which
                              currencies can be sent or received. When you are sending money to
                              a merchant who has requested a currency that is different than your
                              primary currency, you will need to specify whether you want to pay
                              the merchant in the merchant’s requested currency, or in your primary
                              currency. Some merchants may not offer this option. </p>
                          <p>If you send a payment in a currency that is not your primary currency,
                              we follow these practices: </p>
                          <p>If you have a Balance in the requested currency, we will fund your

                          <p>2.2.1 Liability for Invalidated Payments</p>
                          <p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to Bitfung for the full
                              amount of the payment sent to you plus any Fees if the payment is
                              later invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to
                              any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of
                              the payment sent by the sender, plus the applicable Fees listed
                              in the Fees Policy.</p>
                          <li>Balances and Withdrawing Money</li>
                          <p>3.1 Balances </p>
                          <p>If you hold a balance, Bitfung will hold your funds in Exchange
                              Accounts separate from its corporate funds, and it will not use
                              your funds for its operating expenses or for any other corporate
                              purposes. Bitfung will not voluntarily make your funds available
                              to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. You will not receive
                              interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance.
                              Bitfung may receive interest on amounts that Bitfung holds on
                              your behalf.</p>
                          <p>3.2 Negative Balances and Multiple Currencies</p>
                          <p>If your Bitfung Account has a negative balance, Bitfung may set-off
                              the negative balance with any funds that you subsequently add or
                              receive into your Bitfung Account or deduct the amount from a
                              withdrawal you may have requested. If you have multiple currency
                              balances in your Account and one of the currency balances becomes
                              negative for any reason, Bitfung may set-off the negative balance
                              by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance. </p>
                          <p>3.3 Risks of Maintaining Balances in Multiple Currencies</p>
                          <p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining
                              balances in multiple currencies. This may include fluctuating
                              exchange rates. You agree that you will not attempt to use multiple
                              currencies for speculative trading. </p>
                          <p>3.4 Reserves</p>
                          <p>If Bitfung places a reserve on funds in your Bitfung Account, the
                              funds will be shown as “pending” in your Bitfung Account. </p>
                          <p>3.5 Withdrawal Limits </p>
                          <p>For regulatory and fraud prevention purposes, Bitfung generally
                              reserves the right to review any withdrawals and may request
                              additional identity information or other verification information
                              or transaction information before releasing the funds. Failure to
                              provide the necessary information when requested may delay your
                              ability to withdraw funds and may under locals laws be deemed
                              suspicious activity.</p>

                          <p>Fees for Users are specified in the Fees Policy. The Fees Policy
                              constitutes an integral part of this Agreement. </p>
                          <p>4.2 Currency Conversion</p>
                          <p>If your transaction involves a currency conversion by Bitfung,
                              it will be completed at a foreign exchange rate determined by a
                              financial institution, which is adjusted regularly based on
                              market conditions. The exchange rate is adjusted regularly
                              and may be applied immediately and without notice to you.
                              This exchange rate includes a processing fee expressed as a
                              certain percentage above the wholesale exchange rate at which
                              Bitfung obtains foreign currency, and the processing fee is retained
                              by Bitfung.</p>
                          <p>The Currency Conversion Fees that are applicable whenever Bitfung
                              performs a currency conversion are set out in the Fees Policy.</p>

                          <p>Your Agreement with us starts when you successfully register for a
                              Bitfung Account and ends when your Bitfung Account is closed for
                              whatever reason, except that this User Agreement survives termination
                              to the extent and for so long as we require to deal with the closure
                              of your Bitfung Account and to comply with applicable laws and
                              regulations. You can close your Bitfung Account at any time by
                              logging in to your Bitfung Account and then following the
                              instructions. We may close your Bitfung Account at our convenience
                              by providing you with 2 months prior notice. </p>
                          <p>We may also close your Bitfung Account at any time where:  
                              You are in breach of the terms of this User Agreement;  You do
                              not access your Bitfung Account for 3 years; or  We suspect that
                              your Bitfung Account has been accessed without your authorization.  
                              Where we decide to close your Bitfung Account we will provide you
                              with notice of Bitfung Account closure, and where practicable,
                              the reasons for closing your Bitfung Account, together with the
                              ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.  When
                              your Bitfung Account is closed:  We may cancel any pending transactions;
                               We may suspend, limit or terminate your access to or use of the
                              Bitfung Services, websites, software, systems (including any networks
                              and servers used to provide any of the Bitfung Services) operated by
                              us or on our behalf or some or all of the Bitfung Services;  You will
                              remain liable for all outstanding obligations under this User
                              Agreement related to your Bitfung Account prior to closure;  We may
                              keep your Bitfung Account information in our database for the purpose
                              of fulfilling our legal obligations; and  We may retain your Balance
                              after closure to the extent and for the time we reasonably require to
                              protect Bitfung and/or any third party against the risk of Reversals,
                              Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of
                              whatever nature. </p>
                          <li>Your Liability, Remedies and Bitfung Right to Collect from You</li>
                          <p>7.1. You are responsible for  Reversals,  Fees, fines, and penalties</p>
                          <p>Any other liability incurred by Bitfung, a User, or a third party
                              caused by your use of our  Service and/or arising from your breach
                              of this Agreement.</p>
                          <p>You agree to reimburse Bitfung, a User, or a third party for any and
                              all such liability.  "Reversal" means Bitfung reverses a payment you
                              received because (i) it is invalidated by the sender's bank, (ii)
                              it was sent to you in error by Bitfung, its parent, subsidiaries,
                              affiliates, or any direct or indirect Bitfung subsidiary, (iii) the
                              sender of the payment did not have authorization to send the payment
                              (for example: the sender used a stolen credit card or Bitfung account
                              takeover), (iv) you received the payment for activities that violated
                              this Agreement, the Bitfung Acceptable Use Policy, or any other
                              Policy. </p>
                          <p>7.2. Restricted Activities</p>
                          <p>In connection with your use of our website, your Account, the Bitfung
                              Services, or in the course of your interactions with Bitfung, other
                              Bitfung users, or third parties, you will not:  Breach this Agreement,
                              Acceptable Use Policy or any other document incorporated herein, or
                              other Policy that you have agreed to with Bitfung;  Violate any law,
                              statute, ordinance, or regulation;  Infringe Bitfung or any third party's
                              copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual
                              property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy;  Sell counterfeit
                              goods; </p>
                          <p>Act in a manner that is defamatory, trade libelous, threatening or
                              harassing;  Provide false, inaccurate or misleading Information;  
                              Engage in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or
                              transactions;  Refuse to cooperate in an investigation or provide
                              confirmation of your identity or any Information you provide to us;  
                              Control a Bitfung Account that is linked to another Bitfung Account
                              that has engaged in any of these Restricted Activities where Bitfung
                              has reason to believe that both Bitfung Accounts are controlled by
                              the same legal personality or group of legal personalities (including,
                              without limitation, individuals), which is more likely when both
                              Bitfung Accounts share certain attributes, including, without
                              limitation, the same recorded user name, email address, funding
                              source; </p>
                          <p>Facilitate any viruses, Trojan horses, malware, worms or other computer
                              programming routines that attempt to or may damage, disrupt, corrupt,
                              misuse, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or
                              expropriate or gain unauthorized access to any system, data or
                              Information or the Service; </p>
                          <p>Integrate the Service as payment method in a way which makes it
                              impossible for a customer to identify whether he or she is on the
                              Bitfung Website(s) (Example: iFraming, the URL is not visible for
                              the customer);</p>
                          <p>Use an anonymizing proxy; use any robot, spider, other automatic
                              device, or manual process to monitor or copy our website without
                              our prior written permission;  Take any action that may cause us to
                              lose any of the services from our Internet service providers,
                              payment processors, or other suppliers; </p>
                          <p>Allow your use of the Service to present to Bitfung a risk of non-compliance
                              with Bitfung anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and
                              similar regulatory obligations (including, without limitation,
                              where we cannot verify your identity or you fail to complete the
                              steps to lift your sending, receiving or withdrawal limit in accordance
                              with this agreement); </p>
                          <p>7.3 Reimbursement for Your Liability</p>
                          <p>In the event you are liable for any amounts owed to Bitfung, Bitfung
                              may immediately remove such amounts from your Bitfung balance
                              (if available). If there are insufficient funds in your balance
                              to cover your liability, your remaining balance will be removed,
                              your Bitfung Account will have negative balance up to the amount
                              of your liability, and Bitfung reserves the right to collect your
                              debt to Bitfung by using any payments received in your Bitfung Account
                              and otherwise you agree to reimburse Bitfung through other means.
                              Bitfung may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means,
                              including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection
                              agency. </p>
                          <p>Additionally, to secure your performance of this Agreement, you grant to
                              Bitfung a lien on and security interest in your account. </p>
                          <p>7.4 Remedies of Bitfung – Restricted Activities</p>
                          <p>In addition to any other rights under this Agreement, if Bitfung,
                              in its sole discretion, believes that you may have engaged in any
                              Restricted Activities as specified above, we may, at any time take
                              various actions to protect Bitfung, its parent, subsidiaries and
                              affiliates, other third parties or you from Reversals, credit card
                              chargebacks, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability. The
                              actions we may take include but are not limited to the following: </p>
                          <p>We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Bitfung Account or
                              the Service; </p>
                          <p>We may refuse to provide the Bitfung Services to you now and in the future;
                              and </p>
                          <p>We may hold your funds for a period of time reasonably needed to protect
                              against the risk of liability to Bitfung or a third party, or if we
                              believe that you may be engaging in potentially fraudulent or
                              suspicious activity and/or transactions. </p>
                          <p>7.5 Temporary Holds </p>
                          <p>Risk-Based Holds</p>
                          <p>Bitfung, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on any or all of
                              the payments you receive when Bitfung believes there may be a high
                              level of risk associated with you, your Bitfung Account, or any or
                              all of your transactions. Bitfung determination may be based on
                              different factors and Bitfung may rely on information it receives
                              from third parties. If Bitfung places a hold on a payment, the
                              funds will appear in your “pending balance” and the payment status
                              will indicate the hold. If Bitfung places a hold on any or all of
                              the payments you receive, WEX will provide you with notice of our
                              actions. Bitfung will release the hold on any payment after 30 Days
                              from the date the payment was received into your Account unless Bitfung
                              has a reason to continue to hold the payment such as (i) the receipt of
                              a dispute, claim, credit card chargeback, or Reversal, (ii) Bitfung
                              believes that you have violated the terms of this Agreement or any
                              other Policy and that such a violation results in the need to continue
                              holding the funds, or (iii) Bitfung believes that you may be engaging
                              in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions.
                              In such an event, Bitfung may continue holding the payment in your
                              Account until the matter is resolved pursuant to this Agreement.
                              Bitfung, in its sole discretion, may release the hold earlier under
                              certain circumstances, for example when you upload tracking information
                              of the item you shipped. </p>
                          <p>2. Disputed Transactions Holds</p>
                          <p>If a buyer files a Claim, Chargeback or Reversal on a payment you
                              received, Bitfung will place a temporary hold on the funds in your
                              Bitfung account to cover the full amount in dispute. A hold placed
                              under this provision will not restrict your use of the Account with
                              regard to funds other than those disputed or at risk under the Claim,
                              Chargeback or Reversal.</p>
                          <p>7.6 Reserves </p>
                          <p>Bitfung, in its sole discretion, may place a reserve on funds held
                              in your Account when Bitfung believes there may be an increased level
                              or risk associated with your account. If Bitfung places a reserve
                              on funds in your Bitfung Account, the funds will be shown as “pending”
                              in your Bitfung Account. If your Bitfung Account is subject to a
                              Reserve, Bitfung will provide you with notice specifying the terms
                              of the reserve. The terms may require that a certain percentage of
                              the amounts received in your Bitfung Account are held for a certain
                              period of time, or that a certain amount or percentage is held in

                          <li>Legal Disputes </li>
                          <p>In the event a dispute arises between you and Bitfung, our goal is
                              to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving
                              the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you and Bitfung agree that any
                              controversy or claim at law or equity that arises out of this
                              Agreement or Bitfung services ("Claims") shall be resolved in
                              accordance with one of the subsections below, or as otherwise
                              mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties. Before resorting to
                              these alternatives, Bitfung strongly encourages users first to contact
                              Bitfung directly to seek a resolution. Bitfung will consider reasonable
                              requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution
                              procedures, such as mediation, as an alternative to litigation.</p>
                          <p>12.1 Arbitration</p>
                          <p>For any Claim (excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief)
                              where the total amount of the award sought is less than USD 10,000.00,
                              you or Bitfung may elect to resolve the dispute through binding
                              arbitration conducted by telephone, on-line, and/or based solely
                              upon written submissions where no in-person appearance is required.
                              In such cases, the arbitration shall be administered by the Hong Kong
                              International Arbitration Centre, or any other established ADR provider
                              mutually agreed upon by the parties. Any judgment on the award rendered
                              by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                              thereof. </p>
                          <p>12.2 Court</p>
                          <p>Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated by a court of competent
                              jurisdiction located in Hong Kong or where the defendant is located
                              (in Bitfung case, Singapore, and in your case, your home address or
                              principal place of business). You and Bitfung agree to submit to
                              the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Singapore.</p>
                          <p>12.3 Violations of Section 12 </p>
                          <p>All Claims (excluding requests for injunctive or equitable relief)
                              between the parties must be resolved using the dispute resolution
                              mechanism that is selected in accordance with this Section by the
                              party first to assert a Claim, either through a court filing or
                              commencement of arbitration. Should either party file an action
                              contrary to this Section 12, the other party may recover lawyers’
                              fees and costs up to USD 1,000.00, provided that the party seeking the
                              award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed
                              Claim, and the other party has failed to withdraw the Claim. </p>
                          <li>General</li>
                          <p>This Agreement is governed by and interpreted under the laws of Hong
                              Kong as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be
                              performed entirely within Hong Kong. We do not guarantee continuous,
                              uninterrupted or secure access to our service, and operation of our
                              site may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.
                              If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
                              such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.
                              You agree that this Agreement and all incorporated agreements may be
                              automatically assigned by Bitfung, in our sole discretion, to a third party
                              in the event of a merger or acquisition. Headings are for reference purposes
                              only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of
                              such section. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does
                              not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
                              This Agreement and the documents it incorporates set forth the entire
                              understanding between us with respect to the subject matter hereof.
                              Sections (4) Fees, (1.6) Release, (1.8) Limitation of Liability shall
                              survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p>
