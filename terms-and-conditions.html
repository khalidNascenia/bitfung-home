                          <p>1.1 User Relationship</p>
                          <p>Bitfung acts as a facilitator to help customers accept payments and
                              to help customers make payments. Bitfung has independent
                              relationships with the sender and the receiver of payments.
                              We act based upon your direction and your requests to use our
                              Services that require us to perform tasks on your behalf. Bitfung
                              will at all times hold your funds separate from its corporate funds,
                              will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other
                              corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make funds available
                              to its creditors. You acknowledge that (a) Bitfung is not a bank
                              and the Service is a payment processing service rather than a
                              banking service, and (b) Bitfung is not acting as a trustee,
                              fiduciary or escrow with respect to your funds, but is acting
                              only as an agent and custodian. </p>
                          <p>By using Bitfung Services you further agree to the following

                                in order to use the Service, except in certain circumstances where
                                Bitfung reasonably determines your account poses a risk. Bitfung
                                will pool your funds together with funds from other Users, and will
                                place those funds in accounts at one or more financial
                                institutions ("Pooled Accounts"). </p>
                            <p>You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the
                                funds you may keep in your Bitfung.</p>
                            <p>By initiating and making payments through the Service or, where available,
                                adding funds to your balance, you authorize Bitfung to accept funds on
                                your behalf, and to send the funds to the recipient that you designate or
                                into Bitfung Exchange Account, subject to the terms and restrictions of
                                this Agreement. </p>
                            <p>When you initiate a payment, Bitfung will offset funds from the
                                Exchange Account for your benefit to the recipient. When you
                                make a payment, until that payment clears our risk checks and
                                is accepted by the recipient (which may occur instantly or take
                                a few days), you remain the owner of those funds and Bitfung holds
                                those funds for your benefit and on your behalf, but you will not be
                                able to withdraw those funds or send the funds to any other recipient
                                unless you cancel the initial transaction.</p>
                            <p>By receiving payments through the Service, you appoint Bitfung as your
                                agent to cause the funds to be deposited on your behalf in the
                                Exchange Accounts until you further instruct Bitfung with respect
                                to the transmission of your funds. Through the Bitfung Website,
                                you may provide instructions to withdraw the funds or send the funds
                                to a third party, in each case subject to the terms and restrictions
                                of this Agreement. </p>
                          </ol>
                          <p>1.2 Bitfung is only a Payment Service Provider</p>
                          <p>Bitfung acts as a payment service provider by creating, hosting,
                              maintaining and providing our Service to you via the Internet.
                              We do not have any control over, and are not responsible or
                              liable for, the products or services that are paid for with
                              our Service. We cannot ensure that a buyer or a seller you are
                              dealing with will actually complete the transaction. </p>
                          <p>1.3 Identity Authentication</p>
                          <p>We use many techniques to identify our users when they register
                              on our site. Verification of Users is only an indication of
                              increased likelihood that a User's identity is correct.
                              You authorize Bitfung, directly or through third parties,
                              to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your
                              identity and registration. This may include requiring you to
                              provide Bitfung with fax or scanned documentation such as a
                              government issued identification card, address verification
                              documentation, ordering a credit report and performing other
                              credit checks or verifying the information you provide against
                              third party databases. However, because user verification on the
                              Internet is difficult, Bitfung can not and does not guarantee
                              any user's identity.</p>
                          <p>1.4 License grant</p>
                          <p>If you, as a merchant, are using Bitfung software such as an API,
                              developer’s toolkit or other software application which may include
                              software provided by or integrated with software, systems, or
                              services of our service provides that you have downloaded to or
                              otherwise accessed through your computer, device, or other platform
                              then Bitfung and its licensors grant you a revocable, non-exclusive,

                          <p>If you engage in the following behavior, Bitfung may suspend or
                              restrict your access to the Services, hold your funds up to 180 days
                              and fine you, as explained below. Using the Service to receive
                              payments for any sexually oriented or obscene materials or services
                              in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy;</p>

                              extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. In the event
                              that you engage in such activities, then Bitfung may fine you up
                              to USD 3,500.00 for each such violation and/or Bitfung may take
                              legal action against you to recover losses that are in excess

                              USD 3,500.00 is presently a reasonable and genuine minimum estimate

                            <p>Money laundering represents various types of manipulation with cash
                                funds aimed at concealing the illegal origin of illicitly acquired
                                funds.  Illicit funds, according to the Singapore law are defined as
                                those acquired directly or indirectly, through a criminal activity or
                                in other cases specified in the Criminal Procedure Law. </p>

                            <p>Similar to worldwide practices, the financial institutions in Hong Kong
                                apply ‘know your client’ (KYC) principle. KYC principle is aimed at
                                reduction of risk of undermining the financial institution’s reputation
                                due to the clients’ involvement in the transactions of money laundering
                                or terrorism financing.</p>
                            <p>The goal of this principle is to obtain the necessary information about
                                clients and the origination of their funds, and to ensure, that such
                                funds do not have criminal origination and are not used for illicit
                                purposes. In order to assess and control such risks, the financial
                                institutions have to inquire into the profiles of their clients,
                                transactions and the origins of their funds to meet the provisions
